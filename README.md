# Population-Forecasting-for-China-In-Python
Advancements in medicine, technology, and overall quality of life have spurred worldwide population growth in the past few centuries. In 1800, the world population stood just under a billion people, which has now expanded to over 7.5 billion. China alone has a growing population of almost 1.4 billion people. Its population will continue to drastically increase due to improvements in areas such as the size of its middle class, life-expectancy, GDP per capita, quality of medicine, and many others. To accomodate for these future changes bound to transpire, the world as a whole, but specifically the Chinese government, needs to make appropriate adjustments. These adjustments could pertain to the expansion and renovation of infrastructure like educational buildings, medical facilities, housing projects, roads, and other building projects and personnel upgrades in these areas. However, the most essential modifications will be in the allocation of resources, whether that be food, water, or nonrenewable sources of energy. Before starting to work on these valuable projects, it is crucial for China to have an idea of the number of people they will have to serve, which makes modeling population growth paramount.
    Python is the prominent programming language in the field of data science, so its application to fit our goals of modeling populations was appropriate. To begin this process, the Python libraries, which are a collection of readily-available functions and methods that allow code to be reused, Matplotlib and Numpy were imported to aid us in plotting the population, rate of change of population, and the rate of acceleration of the population in China. The years from 1960 to 2017 were stored in a Python list (xyears), which basically stores data points, in this case the integers from 1960 to 2017. Another list (ychinapop) was created to store China’s population for each of these years in chronological order based on data from the World Bank. From there, a for loop, which allows specific parts of the code to be run repeatedly, iterated through the second list mentioned, subtracting the population of every year from the population in the following year and adding this subtracted value to a new list (ychinacpop) which contained the change in rate of population data. Since each change in x (year) was always equal to one year and any number divided by 1 is the same number, there was no need to divide the change in y (population) by the change in x (1).  The same procedure of finding the rate of change of population was done for the list ychinacpop to receive a final list (ychinaccpop), which gave the rate of acceleration of China’s population over the years 1960-2017.
